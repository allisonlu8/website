            <h2>Product Overview</h2>
            <p>After going to visit your favorite bakery, you realize that it's super crowded - long line to order
                and no seats avaiable to sit. This website not only allows users order online and pick up at the location, 
                but also let users reserve a table for a certain time to ensure they have guaranteed seating for whatever reason
                (i.e. studying, working, socializing)

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p> #1: Felix is a student who concentrates with coffee and needs table space whenever he
                visits his favorite bakery because he focuses better in an outdoor environment and 
                has a hard time finding seats. <br>
                #2: Crystal is 
            </p>
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            <p> Allow students and remote workers to request or reserve guarantee seating for a duration
                in order to efficiently do their work, thus enhancing the user experience in a busy bakery. <br>
                Our WhoBao Bakery website will let users know current available drinks/baked goods and hold the 
                items 15 minutes in advance which will affect those that wanted a particular item and can easily 
                pick up their items to go/to find a seat by allowing users to skip the in-store ordering and same 
                them time. We will measure effectiveness by tracking how many users take part in this feature, and 
                see when they start placing the orders and when they pick up the item to see if the time allocated 
                is appropriate.
